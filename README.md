# Data

The data used in this paper can to be obtained from two sources: (1) Metabolomics data for the ROS/MAP and Mayo cohorts, clinical data for the Mayo cohort, and proteomics data for the ROS/MAP cohort are available via the AD Knowledge Portal (https://adknowledgeportal.org). The AD Knowledge Portal is a platform for accessing data, analyses, and tools generated by the Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP-AD) Target Discovery Program and other National Institute on Aging (NIA)-supported programs to enable open-science practices and accelerate translational learning. The data, analyses and tools are shared early in the research cycle without a publication embargo on secondary use. Data is available for general research use according to the following requirements for data access and data attribution (https://adknowledgeportal.org/DataAccess/Instructions). For access to content described in this manuscript see: http://doi.org/10.7303/syn26401311. (2) The full complement of clinical and demographic data for the ROS/MAP cohort are available via the Rush AD Center Resource Sharing Hub and can be requested at https://www.radc.rush.edu.

**Input files for scripts:** enzymes.xlsx, outcomes.xlsx, blsa_results.xlsx, medication_columns.xlsx are provided with content in the input folder. metabolomics_mayo_brain_ms.xlsx, metabolomics_rosmap514_brain_ms.xlsx, metadata_mayo_brain_ms.xlsx, metadata_rosmap514_brain_ms.xlsx, proteomics_rosmap.xlsx are dummy and are provided to guide the format needed. 

# How to

Run scripts in sequence 1 to 8. Scripts 1 and 7 are time consuming, please read the comments in each file for more information. For script 8, a running Cytoscape session is needed to generate network files.
